# Console Tab Example README

## Overview

The Console Tab example demonstrates how to effectively use the Console in Chrome Developer Tools. This example provides a simple HTML page that includes a JavaScript file showcasing various console commands. The purpose of this example is to teach students how to utilize the console for debugging and logging information during web development.

## Purpose

The Console Tab is an essential tool for developers, allowing them to log messages, view errors, and interact with JavaScript code in real-time. This example will help students understand the different console methods available and when to use them.

## Example Description

In this example, we have the following files:

- **index.html**: This file sets up a basic HTML structure and includes the JavaScript file that demonstrates console commands.
- **script.js**: This JavaScript file contains various console methods, including `console.log`, `console.error`, and `console.table`, with inline comments explaining their usage.

## How to Use This Example

1. Open the `index.html` file in Google Chrome.
2. Open the Developer Tools by right-clicking on the page and selecting "Inspect" or by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + I` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + Option + I` (Mac).
3. Navigate to the Console Tab to see the output of the console commands executed in the `script.js` file.
4. Review the inline comments in both the HTML and JavaScript files to understand the purpose of each console method and how to use them effectively.

This example serves as a practical introduction to using the Console Tab in Chrome Developer Tools, providing students with the foundational knowledge they need to debug and log information in their web applications.
