# Network Tab Example README

# Network Tab Example

This directory contains an example that demonstrates how to monitor and analyze network requests using Chrome Developer Tools. The example includes a simple HTML page that makes a network request to a public API, allowing students to see how to inspect network activity in real-time.

## Purpose

The purpose of this example is to teach students how to use the Network tab in Chrome Developer Tools to:

- Monitor network requests made by a web application.
- Inspect request and response headers.
- Analyze the performance of network requests.
- Understand the flow of data between the client and server.

## Files Included

- `index.html`: This file sets up the basic structure of the example and includes a button to trigger a network request.
- `script.js`: This JavaScript file contains the logic for making a network request using the Fetch API. It includes comments explaining how to view request headers, responses, and analyze performance.

## How to Use This Example

1. Open the `index.html` file in Google Chrome.
2. Open Chrome Developer Tools (right-click on the page and select "Inspect" or press `Ctrl + Shift + I`).
3. Navigate to the **Network** tab.
4. Click the button on the page to initiate a network request.
5. Observe the network activity in the Network tab, including the request and response details.
6. Use the comments in `script.js` to understand the code and how it interacts with the network.

This example is designed to be simple and clear, making it easy for educators to demonstrate the functionality of the Network tab in Chrome Developer Tools.
