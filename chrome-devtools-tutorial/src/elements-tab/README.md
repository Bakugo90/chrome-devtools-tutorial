# Elements Tab Example

This folder contains an example that demonstrates how to use the Elements tab in Chrome Developer Tools. The Elements tab allows you to inspect and modify the HTML and CSS of a webpage in real-time. This is a fundamental skill for web development and debugging.

## Purpose

The purpose of this example is to teach students how to:
- Inspect DOM elements
- Modify HTML structure
- Change CSS styles directly in the browser
- Understand the hierarchy and relationships of elements in the DOM

## How to Use This Example

1. **Open the Example**: Open `index.html` in a web browser (preferably Google Chrome).
2. **Access Developer Tools**: Right-click on the page and select "Inspect" or press `Ctrl + Shift + I` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + Option + I` (Mac) to open the Developer Tools.
3. **Navigate to the Elements Tab**: Click on the "Elements" tab in the Developer Tools panel.
4. **Inspect Elements**: Hover over different elements in the HTML structure to see their corresponding visual representation on the page.
5. **Modify Elements**: 
   - Right-click on any element in the Elements tab to edit its HTML or CSS.
   - Use the styles pane to change CSS properties and see the changes reflected immediately on the page.

## Example Overview

The `index.html` file contains a simple HTML structure with various elements. Inline comments within the file explain how to use element selectors and modify styles. This hands-on approach allows students to practice and understand the functionality of the Elements tab effectively.

Encourage students to experiment with different elements and styles to see how changes affect the webpage. This will help reinforce their understanding of the Document Object Model (DOM) and CSS styling.
